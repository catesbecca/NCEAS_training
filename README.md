# New session
Now I am working from RStudio. I will sync later.
Once saved in R, a new modified file is created in R in the Git enironment to the left and to save it in Git, we click save in R, commit after checking the new README file, add comments as needed and now your branch should be so many commits ahead of the origin/master. 

# Second session to create 4 commits


# get in the llama

Commitment is hard but Github will teach me
